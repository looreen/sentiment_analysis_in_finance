Repository for my Bachelor thesis at the Chair of Information Systems at Humboldt University Berlin

Sentiment Analysis is the art to derive opinions or emotional content from written texts and it is used as an important tool in the field of finance. It can be used to predict the behavior of stock markets, financial distress or abnormal financial behavior. In my Bachelor's thesis, I looked deeper into this topic: What are the main topics and methods, what are use cases and where are also limits. Furthermore, I conducted an empirical analysis. I analyzed German Corporate Social Responsibility reports and parts of annual reports to investigate an association with environmental, social and governance rating scores. The aim was to assess sentiment as a risk indicator for these issues. 

The findings where handed in in July 2019 and graded with the top mark 1.0. The thesis is published here: http://dx.doi.org/10.18452/20866

In this repository, the code for the thesis is published.
